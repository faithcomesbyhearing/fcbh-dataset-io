{"id":"jrs-1","title":"Evaluate TTS + VITS + Prosody pipeline quality","description":"Tested complete pipeline: MMS TTS → VITS voice conversion → prosody matching. Results: TTS acceptable, voice conversion and prosody matching both produced unacceptable quality. Root causes: insufficient training data (26 segments vs 30+ min needed), cascading quality loss, DSP prosody limitations.

{"id":"jrs-2","title":"Implement gap preservation for audio stitching","description":"Implemented step-by-step gap matching: measure TTS leading silence, measure original gap, place TTS appropriately (with/without cross-fade). Function: ReplaceSegmentInChapterWithGapMatching(). Tested successfully - preserves 0.700s gap at boundary.

{"id":"jrs-3","title":"Collect more VITS training data for quality improvement","description":"Current training data (26 segments, ~4 min) insufficient for quality voice conversion. Need 30+ minutes of clean, diverse speech with good phonetic coverage. This is blocking acceptable voice conversion quality. Recommendation: collect more data before retraining VITS model.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-16T02:33:57.975815477Z","updated_at":"2025-12-16T02:33:57.975815477Z"}
{"id":"jrs-4","title":"Evaluate corpus-based approach for audio revision","description":"Alternative to TTS+VC: use actual audio snippets from corpus when available. Pros: zero quality loss, natural prosody, no training needed. Cons: requires good corpus coverage. Recommendation: use as primary approach, fall back to TTS only when corpus has no matches.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-16T02:33:58.546952742Z","updated_at":"2025-12-16T02:33:58.546952742Z"}
{"id":"jrs-5","title":"Simplify audio revision pipeline","description":"Current pipeline (TTS → VC → Prosody) produces unacceptable quality due to cascading errors. Simplified approach: Use TTS only (no voice conversion), accept voice mismatch, fewer artifacts. Alternative: Use corpus snippets when available.
