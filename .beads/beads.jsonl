Text normalization: Infer from existing code (check how text is normalized elsewhere in codebase)\n\n2. Input format: Assume html_report generation code will handle word/phrase identification. Will receive aligned text and audio. Long-term may have just timecodes + replacement audio.\n\n3. Distance scoring: Closer is better. Use word-distance, verse-distance, and book-distance. Create a composite 'away-from' score.\n\n4. Speaker matching: Start WITHOUT Actor/Person info. Focus on text matching + distance first. Actor/Person matching will be added later as optimization (makes VC/prosody easier).\n\n5. Return format: By default return best candidate, but provide option to get full ranked list with scores (text match, distance, actor factors).\n\n6. Matching: Start with exact text matching only. No fuzzy/phonetic matching for now (note for later). No manual search UI for now (interesting idea, note for later).\n\n7. Database indexes: Don't add unless functionally needed. Treat schema as not-in-my-domain for now.\n\n8. See #4 above.\n\n9. See #2 above.\n\n10. Context matching: Good idea. Multiple passes - find all candidates first, then secondary searches to rank them by matching context words.\n\n11. Audio snippet extraction: Don't duplicate metadata. Check if reusable layer exists (cli_misc/chop_audio/ uses ffmpeg directly, utility/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.go has ChopOneSegment). Build reusable layer in revise_audio if needed, then refactor chop_audio to use it later.\n\n12.

Audio snippet extraction: Found utility/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.go has ChopOneSegment(ctx, tempDir, inputFile, beginTS, endTS) - perfect reusable function. Will use this directly, no need to build new layer yet.\n\n3. Database queries: Will use SelectWordsByBookChapter and SelectFAScriptTimestamps. Need to query Words table for text matching. Audio file path comes from Scripts.audio_file column.\n\n4. Distance calculation: Will compute verse distance (absolute difference in verse_seq), book distance (0 if same book, 1+ if different), and word distance (position in verse). Composite score: closer = better.\n\n5.
