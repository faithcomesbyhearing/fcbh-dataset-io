Key Features of This Beam Search Decoder

Expected Sequence Integration:

Each hypothesis tracks its position in the expected sequence (ExpectedPos)
The decoder looks ahead when needed to find potential matches


Scoring System with Expected Output Matching:

ExpectedMatchBonus: Rewards for matching an expected token
InsertionPenalty: Penalty for outputting tokens not in the expected sequence
DeletionPenalty: Penalty for skipping tokens in the expected sequence


Lookahead Mechanism:

MaxLookahead parameter controls how far ahead to look in the expected sequence
This enables recovery from insertions or deletions in the ASR output


Efficient Beam Management:

Uses a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently track the best hypotheses
Maintains only the top BeamWidth hypotheses at each step



How This Differs from Standard Beam Search
This implementation extends standard beam search by:

Incorporating knowledge of the expected sequence
Using a dynamic scoring system that balances acoustic model probabilities with expected sequence alignment
Implementing lookahead to handle misalignments between expected and actual sequences
Tracking position in the expected sequence for each hypothesis

Implementation Notes

You'll need to tune the parameters (ExpectedMatchBonus, InsertionPenalty, DeletionPenalty, MaxLookahead) based on your specific ASR task.
This implementation assumes CTC-style decoding, where blank tokens represent "no output". If you're using a different model type, you'll need to adapt accordingly.
For a full implementation, you'd need to add language model integration, which could work alongside the expected sequence matching.
In a production system, you might want to add pruning strategies to keep the beam search efficient for longer sequences.
