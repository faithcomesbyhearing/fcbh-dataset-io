The README.md solution has a weakness, it will not do a good job of identifying words that have
been added to the audio.  The following describes a beam search decoder approach that would
address this issue.


Great choice! A unified beam search can handle both validation and insertion detection in a single pass. Hereâ€™s how to design it:

## Core Concept

Maintain beam hypotheses that can be in two modes:

- **Script mode**: Following the expected script sequence
- **Open mode**: Transcribing unexpected content

## Beam State Design

```python
class BeamHypothesis:
    def __init__(self):
        self.score = 0.0
        self.script_position = 0  # Current position in expected script
        self.output_sequence = []  # What we've "heard" so far
        self.mode = "script"  # "script" or "open"
        self.word_scores = {}  # Confidence for each script word
        self.insertions = []  # Extra words found
```

## Beam Search Algorithm

```python
def unified_beam_search(emissions, script_words, beam_width=10):
    T, vocab_size = emissions.shape
    beam = [BeamHypothesis()]
    
    for t in range(T):
        new_beam = []
        frame_probs = softmax(emissions[t])
        
        for hyp in beam:
            # Expand each hypothesis
            for token_id, prob in enumerate(frame_probs):
                if prob < threshold:  # Skip very unlikely tokens
                    continue
                
                new_hyps = expand_hypothesis(hyp, token_id, prob, script_words, t)
                new_beam.extend(new_hyps)
        
        # Prune beam
        beam = sorted(new_beam, key=lambda x: x.score, reverse=True)[:beam_width]
    
    return beam[0]  # Best hypothesis

def expand_hypothesis(hyp, token_id, prob, script_words, timestep):
    token = id_to_token(token_id)
    new_hyps = []
    
    if token == "<blank>":
        # Continue current hypothesis without change
        new_hyp = copy_hypothesis(hyp)
        new_hyp.score += log(prob)
        new_hyps.append(new_hyp)
    
    elif hyp.mode == "script":
        # Try to match expected script
        expected_word = script_words[hyp.script_position] if hyp.script_position < len(script_words) else None
        
        if expected_word and token_matches_word(token, expected_word):
            # Continue following script
            new_hyp = copy_hypothesis(hyp)
            new_hyp.score += log(prob)
            new_hyp = update_word_progress(new_hyp, token, expected_word, timestep)
            new_hyps.append(new_hyp)
        
        # Also consider switching to open mode (insertion detected)
        open_hyp = copy_hypothesis(hyp)
        open_hyp.mode = "open"
        open_hyp.score += log(prob) - insertion_penalty
        open_hyp.output_sequence.append(token)
        new_hyps.append(open_hyp)
    
    elif hyp.mode == "open":
        # In open mode - transcribe whatever is said
        new_hyp = copy_hypothesis(hyp)
        new_hyp.score += log(prob)
        new_hyp.output_sequence.append(token)
        
        # Check if we can return to script mode
        if can_return_to_script(new_hyp, script_words):
            script_hyp = copy_hypothesis(new_hyp)
            script_hyp.mode = "script"
            script_hyp.score += return_to_script_bonus
            new_hyps.append(script_hyp)
        
        new_hyps.append(new_hyp)
    
    return new_hyps
```

## Word-Level Scoring

```python
def update_word_progress(hyp, token, expected_word, timestep):
    # Track how well current word is being recognized
    if word_complete(hyp.current_word_tokens + [token], expected_word):
        # Word completed successfully
        word_confidence = compute_word_confidence(hyp.current_word_tokens + [token])
        hyp.word_scores[expected_word] = word_confidence
        hyp.script_position += 1
        hyp.current_word_tokens = []
    else:
        hyp.current_word_tokens.append(token)
    
    return hyp
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Mode switching penalties**: Discourage unnecessary mode switches
1. **Word boundary detection**: Decide when words are complete (space tokens, word-piece boundaries, etc.)
1. **Return conditions**: When to switch from open back to script mode
1. **Confidence scoring**: How to score partially recognized words

## Output Format

```python
{
    'script_word_scores': {
        'hello': 0.95,    # High confidence
        'world': 0.12,    # Low confidence (maybe missing)
        'today': 0.88     # Good confidence
    },
    'insertions': [
        {'word': 'um', 'start_frame': 45, 'confidence': 0.92},
        {'word': 'actually', 'start_frame': 120, 'confidence': 0.78}
    ],
    'overall_script_coverage': 0.65  # What fraction of script was clearly spoken
}
```

This approach gives you both validation of expected content AND detection/transcription of unexpected 
content in a single unified process. Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this 
design?
