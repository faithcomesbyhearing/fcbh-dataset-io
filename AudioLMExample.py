1. Load the audio file.
2. Extract the segments based on your timestamps.
3. Preprocess the audio segments to match the input requirements of AudioLM (or the specific model youre using).
4. Encode the preprocessed audio segments using the models encoder.

Below is a Python code example that demonstrates these steps. This example assumes you are using a model 
like AudioLM that has a specific function for encoding audio data. Note that the actual implementation details 
can vary based on the specific neural network library and model you are using (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). 
Ill use generic placeholders where specific model details would be necessary.

First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You might need something like `librosa` for audio processing 
and the appropriate neural network library (e.g., `torch` for PyTorch):

```bash
pip install librosa torch
```

Now, heres a basic Python script outline:

```python
import librosa
import numpy as np
# Assuming PyTorch, replace with the appropriate library and model
import torch

# Function to load and preprocess audio segments
def preprocess_audio(file_path, start_times, end_times, sample_rate=16000):
    # Load the full audio file
    audio, _ = librosa.load(file_path, sr=sample_rate)
    segments = []

    # Extract audio segments based on start and end times
    for start, end in zip(start_times, end_times):
        start_sample = int(start * sample_rate)
        end_sample = int(end * sample_rate)
        segment = audio[start_sample:end_sample]
        segments.append(segment)

    # Preprocess segments if necessary (e.g., normalization, padding)
    # This step will vary based on your model's requirements
    preprocessed_segments = [librosa.util.fix_length(segment, size=desired_length) for segment in segments]  # Example
    return preprocessed_segments

# Function to encode preprocessed audio segments with your neural net (dummy example)
def encode_segments(segments):
    model = torch.load('your_model.pth')  # Load your model
    encoded_segments = []

    for segment in segments:
        # Convert segment to tensor, add batch dimension, etc.
        segment_tensor = torch.tensor(segment).unsqueeze(0)  # Example adjustment
        # Encode with your model
        encoded = model(segment_tensor)
        encoded_segments.append(encoded.detach().numpy())  # Convert back to numpy array if necessary

    return encoded_segments

# Example usage
file_path = 'your_audio_file.wav'
start_times = [0, 15, 30]  # Example start times in seconds
end_times = [14, 29, 44]   # Example end times in seconds

# Preprocess the audio segments
segments = preprocess_audio(file_path, start_times, end_times)
# Encode the segments
encoded_segments = encode_segments(segments)
```

Replace `'your_audio_file.wav'`, `'your_model.pth'`, and the preprocessing part with your actual data and model. The preprocessing and encoding functions should be adapted based on the specific requirements of the neural network and the format of your audio files.

Remember, the details like `desired_length` for the audio segments, the way you load and preprocess your audio data, and how you load and apply your neural network model can vary significantly based on your specific use case and the neural network framework you're using.
